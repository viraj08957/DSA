programming language help us to instruct computer to do some stuff.

- type of lanaguage

1) Procedural language
 -- specifies a series of well-structure steps and procedure to compose a programme 
 -- contain a systematic order of statement,functions and commands to complete a task 

2) Functional language
 -- writing a programm only in pure function i.e never modify variable but only create 
    new ones as an output
 -- use in situation where we have to perform lot of different operation on the same set of 
    data 
 -- first class functions?

3) object oriented language
 -- revolve around obeject 
 -- code + data = object 
 -- developed to make it easier to develop,debug,reuse and maintain software 


static VS Dynamic languages 

static                                   Dynamic language 
-perform type checking at compile      - perform tyepe checking at runtime 
 time                              
-error will show at compile time       -error might not show till program is run 
-declare datatype before you use it    - no need to declare datatype of variable
-more control                          - save time in writing code but might give 
                                            error at runtime 



notes :-
 let a = 10 
 so a is called as refference variable 
 and the value 10 called as object 

 so variable stored in stack memoery 
 and object stored in heap memory 

 there is concept when a object doesn't have any referrence then 
 garbage collector came and delete it from memory.
